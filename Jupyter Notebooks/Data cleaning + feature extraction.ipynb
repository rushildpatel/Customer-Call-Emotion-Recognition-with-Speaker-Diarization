For this reason I will use the module `noisereduce` and apply a light reduction of 10% for the stationary noise on all the samples. The reason for such reduction is due to the fact that this operation can also sensibly lower the quality of the signal thus removing also meaningful information of the audio for the next steps.\n","(https://pypi.org/project/noisereduce/)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"995888d9-e20a-4ea9-b0c6-5f8b70c46a0f","metadata":{"tags":[],"id":"995888d9-e20a-4ea9-b0c6-5f8b70c46a0f"},"outputs":[],"source":["path
